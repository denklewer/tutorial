        "# Exercise 1 - Simple Data Parallel Example\n",
        "\n",
        "**GOAL:** The goal of this exercise is to show how to run simple tasks in parallel.\n",
        "\n",
        "This script is too slow, and the computation is embarrassingly parallel. In this exercise, you will use Ray to execute the functions in parallel to speed it up.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Concept for this Exercise - Remote Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "The standard way to turn a Python function into a remote function is to add the `@ray.remote` decorator. Here is an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# A regular Python function.\n",
        "def regular_function():\n",
        "    return 1\n",
        "\n",
        "# A Ray remote function.\n",
        "@ray.remote\n",
        "def remote_function():\n",
        "    return 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The differences are the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Invocation:** The regular version is called with `regular_function()`, whereas the remote version is called with `remote_function.remote()`.\n",
        "2. **Return values:** `regular_function` immediately executes and returns `1`, whereas `remote_function` immediately returns an object ID (a future) and then creates a task that will be executed on a worker process. The result can be obtained with `ray.get`.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    >>> regular_function()\n",
        "    1\n",
        "    \n",
        "    >>> remote_function.remote()\n",
        "    ObjectID(1c80d6937802cd7786ad25e50caf2f023c95e350)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    >>> ray.get(remote_function.remote())\n",
        "    1\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "3. **Parallelism:** Invocations of `regular_function` happen **serially**, for example\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    # These happen serially.\n",
        "    for _ in range(4):\n",
        "        regular_function()\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    whereas invocations of `remote_function` happen in **parallel**, for example\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    # These happen in parallel.\n",
        "    for _ in range(4):\n",
