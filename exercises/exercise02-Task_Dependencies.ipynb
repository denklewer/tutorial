        "In this exercise, we construct a sequence of tasks each of which depends on the previous mimicking a data parallel application. Within each sequence, tasks are executed serially, but multiple sequences can be executed in parallel.\n",

        "### Concept for this Exercise - Task Dependencies\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose we have two remote functions defined as follows.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@ray.remote\n",
        "def f(x):\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Arguments can be passed into remote functions as usual.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        ">>> x1_id = f.remote(1)\n",
        ">>> ray.get(x1_id)\n",
        "1\n",
        "\n",
        ">>> x2_id = f.remote([1, 2, 3])\n",
        ">>> ray.get(x2_id)\n",
        "[1, 2, 3]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object IDs** can also be passed into remote functions. When the function actually gets executed, **the argument will be a retrieved as a regular Python object**.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        ">>> y1_id = f.remote(x1_id)\n",

        "[1, 2, 3]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "So when implementing a remote function, the function should expect a regular Python object regardless of whether the caller passes in a regular Python object or an object ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task dependencies affect scheduling.** In the example above, the task that creates `y1_id` depends on the task that creates `x1_id`. This has the following implications.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The second task will not be executed until the first task has finished executing.\n",
        "- If the two tasks are scheduled on different machines, the output of the first task (the value corresponding to `x1_id`) will be copied over the network to the machine where the second task is scheduled."
